## 3. Style Guide 
Here we are going to define our style guide for the project. These are rules that we used while implementing the web application.

### 3.1 JavaScript
For JavaScript (.js) files here are the rules : 

* Imports 
  * Importing modules we will be using the `<require>` keyword.
  * The name given to the variable containing the import is declared with const and the name starts with a small Letter.
  ```js
  const mongoose = Require('mongoose');
  const mongodbServer = Require('mongodb').Server;
  const appClients = Require('./clients/app');
  ```
* Functions 
  * Apart from `App.js`, for functions, we are going to prioritize promises than callbacks. Meaning when possible we are going to always return promises. 
  * Async / sync functions ? this will depend on the developers needs.
  * Functions name will started with a small letter but a Capital letter is a must when starting a new word.
  ```js
  async function fetchFromDb(db, spec){
    ...
  }
  ```
  * In `App.js`, we don't create functions, we only import and use them in routers callbacks. Most of functions imported are in `private/js`.
* In `Server.js`, we import the app and connect the server to our database.
  
 ### 3.2 CSS 
 For the Cascading Style Sheets (.css) files we are going to prioritize classes over ids. So that we can use the ids in for the front end javascript programing.
 
 ### 3.3 HTML
 The html files are mostly going to be `<templates>` that use mustache [mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js).
 
 ## 4. Folder Organisation
 We have 5 main folders : db, private, static, templates and tests folder.
 
 ### 4.1 Db
 This folder contains the plan( structure ) of our database.
 
 ### 4.2 Private 
 
 #### 4.2.1 js
  This sub-folder is for all *back-end functions*. All functions in this folder are exported and most of them are the ones exported in `app.js`. 
  You can find also the schemas of our database in `private/js/general` folder.
 
 #### 4.2.2 ssl
  This sub-folder contains the key and certificates generated by https. 
 
 ### 4.3 Static
 
 #### 4.3.1 Css
  This sub-folder contains the css of web application.
 
 #### 4.2.2 Images
  This sub-folder contains all images used in our web application.
 
 #### 4.2.3 Js
  This sub-folder contains all functions for front-end dynamic intervention.
 
 ### 4.4 Templates
  This folder has all HTML pages of our web application.
